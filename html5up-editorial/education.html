									<h2>B.B.A. Business Analytics and Infromation Systems</h2>
									<p>As a student in the Business Analytics & Information Systems (BAIS) program, I have gained valuable skills in technologies such as Excel, Oracle APEX, Python, R Programming, and SQL. Throughout my coursework and hands-on experience, I have developed the ability to analyze complex data sets and make data-driven decisions, which will be essential in any technology or data-related role. The program has also given me a strong foundation in business and management principles, which will be valuable in any organization. I have learned how to use data and technology to solve business problems and improve efficiency. Additionally, the program's emphasis on teamwork and collaboration has allowed me to develop strong communication and interpersonal skills that are essential in any workplace. Overall, the BAIS program has equipped me with the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in a rapidly evolving and technology-driven business world.</p>

									<h2>B.S. Sport and Recreation Management</h2>
									<p>As a student in the Sport and Recreation Management (SRM) program, I have gained knowledge of foundational principles and their applications in financial, human resource and facility management, marketing, communications, sales strategies, and legal concepts. The program has also offered me opportunities to evaluate and explore career paths in various sport and recreation industries, acquire knowledge in a concentration area unique to my career objectives, and express ideas clearly, logically, and persuasively. The curriculum challenges me to think critically and creatively while developing analytical, rhetorical, and research abilities required for leadership positions in the industry. The program also emphasizes experiential learning opportunities, allowing me to apply concepts and skills in professional settings and enhance my learning and development. Thanks to the SRM program, I am now prepared to make meaningful contributions to the industry at all levels, while also broadening my understanding and appreciation of the sport and recreation field.</p>

									<h2>Event Management Certificate</h2>
									<p>As a student in the Event Management program at the University of Iowa, I am thrilled about the skills and knowledge that I have acquired through the program. The program has given me a comprehensive understanding of the event industry, and the coursework has provided me with practical skills in planning, organizing, and executing successful events. Furthermore, I had the opportunity to gain real-world experience through internships and guided experiences. As a result, the certificate program has not only equipped me with valuable skills but also provided me real-life clients to gain experience planning events outside of the classroom.</p>
