											<p>I was one of five students selected from a highly competitive pool of BAIS (Business Analytics & Information Systems) majors to establish a new student ambassador program within the Tippie College of Business. Our mission is to showcase the various aspects of the BAIS major and to recruit new students, particularly targeting women and minorities who are underrepresented in this field. We meet weekly to devise new strategies and periodically collaborate with Tippie leaders to develop campaigns and initiatives aimed at recruitment and achieving our goals. In our efforts, we distribute information, flyers, and other materials to organizations both within and outside the Tippie College of Business. We coordinate with student organizations, high school teachers and students, as well as community colleges to share information about BAIS. Additionally, we educate advisors and admissions staff about the BAIS program to enhance their ability to engage prospective students. As needed, I also help arrange and conduct individual tours, respond to inquiries from prospective students, and support the Business Student Ambassador Organization (BSAO).</p>

									<h2 style="color:mediumvioletred">Green Bandana Project</h2>
									<h4>Founder & President | The University of Iowa | Iowa City, IA</h4>
									<p>April 2022 to Present</p>
									<p>I founded the Green Bandana Project as a student organization at The University of Iowa, emerging from a class project, with a primary focus on promoting mental health awareness on campus. I lead and manage the organization's operations, overseeing a membership base of over 350 individuals, and maintain regular communication through meetings and bi-weekly updates. Working closely with the executive board, I strategize and plan semester events, general meetings, and ensure efficient financial planning and adherence to event timelines. To enhance team collaboration and project coordination, I implemented a BAND Channel for streamlined communication. Additionally, I manage task lists and event calendars for the executive board, ensuring efficient project execution and event planning. I foster partnerships with various university departments, including University of Iowa Athletics, Tippie College of Business, and the School of Journalism and Mass Communication. Collaboration also extends to external organizations and businesses such as Community Partnerships for Protecting Children in Iowa, Iowa City Public Library, Iowa City West High School, and MidWestOne Bank. Throughout my involvement, I have continuously advocated for mental health awareness, suicide prevention, and worked to diminish the stigma associated with seeking help for mental health within the university community.</p>

									<h2 style="color:mediumvioletred">Women in Business</h2>
									<h4>General Member | The University of Iowa: Tippie College of Business | Iowa City, IA</h4>
									<p>September 2021 to December 2022</p>
									<p>I attended one to three events per week that focused on addressing common barriers women face in the business industry, which contributed to my professional development and leadership skills. These events encompass a range of activities including community service, philanthropy, case competitions, and speaker presentations. Additionally, I participated in various social events and networking opportunities, which allowed me to connect with peers and industry professionals, further enriching my experience and expanding my professional network.</p>
