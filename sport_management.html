									<h2>Speed and Sustainability: Addressing Modern Challenges in NASCAR</h2>
									<h4>Contemporary Issues in Sports</h4>
									<p>August 2022 to December 2022</p>
									<p>This paper explores NASCAR's current challenges, including a decline in viewership and significant concerns with the Next Gen car's safety and environmental impact. Founded in 1948, NASCAR has recently lost ground to Formula One, partly due to F1's increased visibility from media coverage. The Next Gen car, designed to enhance safety and simplify team operations, ironically heightened risk with severe impacts in usual crashes, leading to urgent calls for improvements in the 2023 designs. Concurrently, NASCAR faces environmental scrutiny over its significant carbon emissions and resource use, despite efforts like the NASCAR Green initiative promoting biofuels and recycling. The paper argues for a more aggressive approach in aligning NASCAR's practices with its sustainability preaching to ensure the sport's relevance and integrity in a changing world.</p>

									<h2>The Olympic Games Need to Have a Permanent Home</h2>
									<h4>Sport Business Practices</h4>
									<p>August 2022 to December 2022</p>
									<p>This report advocates for establishing a permanent home for the Olympic Games, discussing the economic, environmental, and political challenges associated with the current model where the Games are hosted in different cities every four years. It covers the financial losses often incurred by host cities, the temporary nature of job creation, and the underwhelming economic impact compared to expectations. The report proposes Athens, Greece, as the ideal permanent location, highlighting its historical significance, existing infrastructure, and potential economic benefits for the struggling Greek economy. The suggestion aims to reduce political complexities, ensure better sustainability, and focus global attention on athletic competition rather than the logistical and financial burdens of hosting the Games. The work includes various studies and expert opinions supporting the argument for a permanent Olympic venue.</p>
