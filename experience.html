										<div class="text-box5">
											<p>June 2024 to Present</p>
											<p>I oversee 15 venue spaces across 6 athletic facilities, 10 of which are available for external rentals. These spaces accommodate a variety of events beyond athletics, including university functions, community gatherings, non-profit fundraisers, and private celebrations. My daily responsibilities involve coordinating with internal teams and external clients to book events such as banquets, meetings, recruiting events, holiday parties, and rehearsal dinners. I also manage event setup, communicate with University Catering, lead venue and facility tours, handle rental contracts and billing, and track both revenue and non-revenue events. Additionally, I prepare premium spaces for home games and competitions, including football, basketball, and wrestling.</p>
											<p>Between FY 2024 and mid-FY 2025, I increased event revenue by approximately 70% and grew event volume by around 44%, from 36 to 52 events. I introduced on-field photo opportunities at Kinnick Stadium as a new rental offering, enhancing the guest experience and generating new revenue. To boost community engagement and visibility, I created and manage Instagram and Facebook pages for our venues. I also developed comprehensive guidebooks for event supervisors to simplify tasks such as operating venue technology, troubleshooting A/V equipment, understanding event procedures, and accessing emergency contacts.</p>
											<p>Operationally, I contributed to the launch of a work order system at Kinnick Stadium to distinguish event-related cleaning from general maintenance, significantly improving efficiency. I partnered with digital media and technology teams to integrate our rental website into hawkeyesports.com, replacing an outdated standalone site. I led upgrades to the new site by adding venue options, updating policies, refreshing imagery, and ensuring the contact form directs inquiries appropriately.</p>

									<h2 style="color:mediumvioletred">Lead Desk Clerk</h2>
									<h4>Division of Student Life at The University of Iowa | Iowa City, IA</h4>
									<p>August 2022 to June 2024</p>
									<p>As lead desk clerk, I fulfill all traditional desk duties and serve as the main point of contact for all desk clerks, playing a key role in streamlining communications and operations. Over the years, I have participated in at least 10 applicant interviews for the regular desk clerk position and trained over 30 desk clerks and resident assistants on desk basics, including key audits, using StarRez, handling mail and packages, and locating resources. Each year, I prepare all desk clerks and facilitate the move-in of approximately 600 residents while working closely with our Office Administrator and Hall Coordinator. I typically schedule between 14 and 16 desk clerks each year for move-in, school semesters, school breaks, and finals. Additionally, I coordinate monthly meetings to discuss updates or necessary changes in an effort to build a close-knit team. I prioritize effective communication and foster a cohesive environment among desk clerks by primarily using GroupMe and Microsoft Teams.</p>

											<p>July 2023 to May 2024</p>
											<p>I held a security guard license issued by the Iowa Department of Public Safety and a Trained Crowd Manager certificate through the International Association of Venue Managers (IVAM). I played an essential role in ensuring exceptional service to fans at various events for University of Iowa Athletics and Xtream Arena. My responsibilities extended from exhibiting customer service before, during, and after games and events to crowd control measures that prevented congestion and ensured efficient fan movement. On average, I supervised a team of 10-12 employees and developed the necessary skills to confidently handle any unexpected situation.</p>

									<h2 style="color:mediumvioletred">Fans First Practicum</h2>
									<h4>Sport and Recreation Management Program at The University of Iowa | Iowa City, IA</h4>
									<p>August 2023 to December 2023</p>
									<p>As a Game Day Customer Service Representative with Fans First at The University of Iowa, I worked a variety of sporting events, including Iowa Hawkeyes Football, Volleyball, and Gymnastics. My role involved actively contributing to the enhancement of the game day experience by providing valuable feedback and recommendations to event management professionals. This involvement allowed me to play a significant part in improving the atmosphere and satisfaction for all attendees.</p>

									<h2 style="color:mediumvioletred">Race Control Intern</h2>
                                    <h4>Tri-State Raceway | Earlville, IA</h4>
									<p>May 2022 to October 2022</p>
									<p>I was responsible for adding and reviewing racer files in the Compulink StarTrak database system, continuously updating information as necessary. Prior to eliminations, I entered tech cards into the system and ensured all information was accurate and current. I also edited and deleted qualifying results as needed for various reasons, such as reruns. After every round and for each class, I verified and sent ladders to pit lane staff via a remote system. Additionally, I calculated racer points after every event for each class and made necessary revisions in Compulink. Among the large-scale events I worked included a 3-day event for Triple 777 Bracket Racing, handling up to 340 cars per day, and the NHRA National Open, which featured approximately 300 cars each day.</p>
