									<h2>CSC Event Intern</h2>
                                    <h4>CSC - Contemporary Services Corporation | Iowa City, IA</h4>
									<p>July 2023 to Present</p>
									<p>I hold a security guard license issued by the Iowa Department of Public Safety and a Trained Crowd Manager certificate through the International Association of Venue Managers (IVAM). I play an essential role in ensuring exceptional service to fans at various events for University of Iowa Athletics and Xtream Arena. My responsibilities extend from exhibiting customer service before, during, and after games and events to crowd control measures that prevent congestion and ensure efficient fan movement. On average, I supervise a team of 10-12 employees, and have developed the necessary skills to confidently handle any unexpected situation.</p>

									<h2>Lead Desk Clerk</h2>
                                    <h4>The University of Iowa: University Housing & Dining | Iowa City, IA</h4>
									<p>August 2022 to Present</p>
									<p>As lead desk clerk, I fulfill all traditional desk duties and serve as the main point of contact for all desk clerks, playing a key role in streamlining communications and operations. Over the years, I have participated in at least 10 applicant interviews for the regular desk clerk position and trained over 30 desk clerks and resident assistants on desk basics, including key audits, using StarRez, handling mail and packages, and locating resources. Each year, I prepare all desk clerks and facilitate the move-in of approximately 600 residents while working closely with our Office Administrator and Hall Coordinator. I typically schedule between 14 and 16 desk clerks each year for move-in, school semesters, school breaks, and finals. Additionally, I coordinate monthly meetings to discuss updates or necessary changes in an effort to build a close-knit team. I prioritize effective communication and foster a cohesive environment among the desk clerks by primarily using GroupMe and Microsoft Teams.</p>

									<h2>Fans First Practicum</h2>
									<h4>The University of Iowa: Sport and Recreation Management | Iowa City, IA</h4>
									<p>August 2023 to December 2023</p>
									<p>As a Game Day Customer Service Representative with Fans First at The University of Iowa, I worked a variety of sporting events, including Iowa Hawkeyes Football, Volleyball, and Gymnastics. My role involved actively contributing to the enhancement of the game day experience by providing valuable feedback and recommendations to event management professionals. This involvement allowed me to play a significant part in improving the atmosphere and satisfaction for all attendees.</p>

									<h2>Race Control Intern</h2>
                                    <h4>Tri-State Raceway | Earlville, IA</h4>
									<p>May 2022 to October 2022</p>
									<p>I was responsible for adding and reviewing racer files in the Compulink StarTrak database system, continuously updating information as necessary. Prior to eliminations, I entered tech cards into the system and ensured all information was accurate and current. I also edited and deleted qualifying results as needed for various reasons, such as reruns. After every round and for each class, I verified and sent ladders to pit lane staff via a remote system. Additionally, I calculated racer points after every event for each class and made necessary revisions in Compulink. Among the large-scale events I worked included a 3-day event for Triple 777 Bracket Racing, handling up to 340 cars per day, and the NHRA National Open, which featured approximately 300 cars each day.</p>
