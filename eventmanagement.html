									<h3>Fly D.C. Presented by the Eastern Iowa Airport</h3>
                                    <h4>Event Management Workshop</h4>
									<p>I recently had the opportunity to be part of an event planning team for the Eastern Iowa Airport in Cedar Rapids, IA. Our client, Pam Hinman is the Director of Marketing and Communications for the Eastern Iowa Airport. On June 1, 2023 a direct flight will launch from the Eastern Iowa Airport to the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Washington D.C. Our task was to plan a flight launch party to spread the word to University of Iowa faculty and staff.</p>
                                    <p>We began brainstorming event ideas as a team and settled on an outside walkthrough event at Hubbard Park. Our goal was to keep the event short, informative, and as interactive as possible. We used IMU Catering for the event and incorporated Washington D.C. themes within our cupcakes and cookies. We also included "jet juice", which was fruit punch, and gourmet grilled cheese bites as that is a popular food in Washington D.C.</p>
                                    <p>To keep the event interactive we utilized the stair truck provided by the Eastern Iowa Airport to host a paper airplane contest where guests had the opportunity to win prizes depending on where their paper airplane landed. While this was the main attraction at our event, we also had a few information tables to provide details about the upcoming flight and helpful tips for when traveling to Washington D.C.</p>
                                    <p>As the Crises, Sustainability & Guest Experience lead, I was responsible for ensuring that guests had a favorable time at the event and that there were plenty of sustainable options. Sustainability was an essential aspect of the event for us, and we focused on ensuring that our event had a minimal negative impact on the environment. We provided guests with trash and recycling bins and offered QR codes for more information instead of flyers and pamphlets. We also utilized additional trash cans to make the location more convenient than the permanent ones already in Hubbard Park.</p>
                                    <p>I also created a guidebook on Washington D.C. that was showcased at the information table. The guidebook contained direct flight information from the Eastern Iowa Airport to the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Washington D.C. as well as hotel and restaurant options along with different activities or areas of interest for people. To limit the use of paper at our event, we had one copy printed for guests to flip through and a QR code for guests to scan and save the guidebook for a later.</p>
